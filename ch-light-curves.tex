\chapter{Light Curves}

A light curve is a time series of unresolved optical brightness measurements. Once an object is far
enough away from the observer to become unresolved, all geometric data is lost and the only
information that remains in the individual measurements is the total brightness. "Brightness" is a
catch-all term for a variety of units. 

\section{Brightness Units}

\subsection{Irradiance}

Irradiance is the standard SI linear unit used to describe the total amount of energy incident on a
surface from a given source. An irradiance of $1 \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$ implies that a $10
\: [m]$ area would experience $10 \: [W]$ of incident power. The Sun's irradiance is approximately
$1361 \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$ at a distance of $1$ AU. 

Visual magnitude ---  also known as apparent or relative magnitude --- is a reverse logarithmic scale
that originates in astronomy. Stellar sources span many orders of magnitude of brightness, making a
logarithmic scale a helpful middle ground for comparison. Note that apparent magnitude always
expresses brightness at the observer's location; absolute magnitude is a different quantity that
normalizes brightness from a distance of $10$ parsecs. In terms of irradiance, apparent magnitude
is computed via Eq \ref{eq:irradiance_to_mag}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:irradiance_to_mag}
  m = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)
\end{equation}

In Eq \ref{eq:irradiance_to_mag}, $I$ is the irradiance of the source of interest and $I_0$ is
irradiance of the zero-point source. This makes sense as if we plug in $I = I_0$, we are left with
$m=0$. The star Vega is usually taken to be the zero-point with irradiance $I_0 = 2.518021002\cdot
10^{-8} \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$.

We can rearrange Eq \ref{eq:irradiance_to_mag} to compute irradiance from a given apparent magnitude,
yielding Eq \ref{eq:mag_to_irradiance}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mag_to_irradiance}
  I = I_0 \cdot 10^{-\frac{m}{2.5}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Normalized Irradiance}

This work also uses normalized irradiance, the irradiance of a source if the observer was $1$ meter
away. This is a non-standard quantity in the literature, but proves useful for the same reasons
absolute magnitude is used by astronomers. Adjusting sources to be at a standard distance allows us
to simulate and invert light curves in a non-dimensionalized space, simplifying simulation and
making the inversion optimizations more robust. To make the conversion explicit, irradiance observed
at a distance $r$ in meters from an object is converted to normalized irradiance $\hat{I}$ in watts via Eq
\ref{eq:irradiance_to_norm_irradiance}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:irradiance_to_norm_irradiance}
  \hat{I} = r^2 I
\end{equation}

\subsection{$S_{10}$}

While magnitude and irradiance do a good job describing the flux of point sources, other units exist
to talk about diffuse or extended sources where brightness is somewhat uniformly spread over an
area. $S_{10}$ is a unit of surface brightness represented by the number of 10th magnitude stars per square degree that would produce the same flux.
Surface brightness in $S_{10}$ over a given solid angle $\Omega \: \left[ rad^2 \right]$ can be converted to total irradiance $I \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$ via Eq \ref{eq:s10toirrad}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:s10toirrad}
 \frac{I \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]}{S_{10}} = 10^{-10/2.5} \left( \Omega \frac{180^2}{\pi^2} \right)
  \int_{10^{-8}}^{10^{-6}}{ \textrm{STRINT}(\lambda) \: d\lambda} = 8.26617 \Omega \cdot 10^{-9}
\end{equation}

In \ref{eq:s10toirrad}, $\textrm{STRINT}(\lambda) \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2 \cdot m} \right]$ is the
representative spectrum of a 0th magnitude star, $\textrm{QE}(\lambda)$ is the quantum efficiency
spectrum of the observing sensor, $\textrm{ATM}(\lambda)$ is the atmospheric transmission spectrum, $\lambda \: [m]$ is wavelength, $h \: \left[
\frac{m^2 \cdot kg}{s} \right]$ is Plank's constant, and $c \: \left[ \frac{m}{s^2} \right]$ is the
speed of light in vacuum. 

\subsection{Magnitudes per Square Arcsecond}

A second surface brightness unit is $\left[ \frac{mag}{arcsec^2} \right]$, also known as MPSAS (magnitudes per square arcsecond) or SQM (sky quality meter). This quantity can be thought of as a generalized $S_{10}$, where instead of quantifying the number of stars of a certain
magnitude in a solid angle, we measure the equivalent magnitude of a single point source. A surface
brightness $B_{10}$ in $S_{10}$ can be converted into surface brightness $B_{mag}$ in 
$\left[ \frac{mag}{arcsec^2} \right]$ via Eq \ref{s10_to_mag_per_a2}.

\begin{equation} \label{s10_to_mag_per_a2}
	B_{mag} = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \frac{B_{10} \cdot 10^{-4}}{12960000} \right)
\end{equation}

In Eq \ref{s10_to_mag_per_a2} we first convert $S_{10}$ to the total irradiance per square degree,
convert square degrees to square arcseconds, and transform the result back into apparent magnitude. We can convert from MPSAS to irradiance per steradian via Eq \ref{eq:mpsas_to_irrad_per_ster} using \ref{eq:mag_to_irradiance}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mpsas_to_irrad_per_ster}
  I = \left( \frac{180}{ 3600\pi} \right)^2 I_0 \cdot 10^{-\frac{MPSAS}{2.5}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Candela} \label{sec:candela}

Some light pollution datasets are given in units that include candela. Candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity defined by the International Committee for Weights and Measures as "Fixing the numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency $540\cdot10^{12}$ Hz to be equal to exactly $683$" \cite{nist_units}. This means that an isotropic source with frequency $540\cdot10^{12}$ Hz ($\lambda = 555$ nm) has a luminous efficacy of $K_{cd} = 683 \: \left[ lm/W \right]$ where lm stands for lumens. Luminous efficacy itself determines how well a source produces visible light. For a given wavelength, we convert from candela $B_{cd}$ to watts per steradian $B_{wsr}$ via \ref{eq:cd_to_w_per_sr}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cd_to_w_per_sr}
  B_{wsr}(\lambda) = \frac{B_{cd}}{K_{cd}(\lambda)}
\end{equation}

The luminous efficiency function $K_{cd}(\lambda)$ models the human eye's response to the visible spectrum \cite{sharpe2005}. Different fits of this function exist; we adopt that of Sharpe et al. \cite{sharpe2005}, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:luminous_efficiency}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\figbig]{sphx_glr_luminous_efficiency_001_2_00x.png}
  \caption{Luminous effiency function from \cite{sharpe2005}}
  \label{fig:luminous_efficiency}
\end{figure}

Candela per unit area can be converted into MPSAS by combining Eq \ref{eq:cd_to_w_per_sr} with \ref{eq:irradiance_to_mag}, yielding Eq \ref{eq:cd_per_m2_to_mpsas}, which is still a function of the source's wavelength.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cd_per_m2_to_mpsas}
  MPSAS(\lambda) = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \frac{B_{cd}}{\left( \frac{180}{ 3600\pi} \right)^2 K_{cd}(\lambda) I_0} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Photoelectron Counts}

Raw observations of brightness taken by a CCD-equipped telescope are measured in photoelectron
counts, otherwise known as Analog-to-Digital Units (ADU) \cite{krag2003}. The count in a single
pixel obtained is directly proportional (via the ADU gain) to the number of
photons incident on that pixel during the integration time. Higher order effects in the silicon of
the CCD makes this statement incomplete at best, but for the non-resolved imaging applications we're
concerned about, chip-level innacuracies besides readout noise and dark current are often neglected
\cite{frueh2019notes}. Irradiance can be converted back and forth to ADU via the conversion factor $SINT$
in Eq \ref{eq:sint} \cite{krag2003}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sint}
 \textrm{SINT} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}
	\int_{10^{-8}}^{10^{-6}}{ \left( \frac{\textrm{SUN}(\lambda)}{I_{sun}} \right) \cdot \textrm{QE}(\lambda) \cdot \textrm{ATM}(\lambda)
  \cdot \left( \frac{\lambda}{h c} \right) \: d\lambda}  
\end{equation}

In Eq \ref{eq:sint}, $\textrm{SUN}(\lambda)$ is the spectrum of solar irradiance in 
$\left[\frac{W}{m^2\cdot m} \right]$, $I_{sun}$ is the irradiance of the Sun (generally taken to be
the solar constant $1361 \: \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$. Read literally, the integral term as
units $\left[ \frac{1}{Ws} \right]$, giving the number of counts per incident Watt of solar
radiation and second of integration time. The aperture diameter factor outside the imtegral accounts
for the area of light incident on the CCD, giving $\textrm{SINT}$ units of $\left[ \frac{m^2}{Ws}
\right]$. Multiplying by irradiance in $\left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$ and an integration time $\Delta t$ 
in seconds will yield the count of photoelectrons $S$ in ADU as shown in Eq \ref{eq:irrad_to_count}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:irrad_to_count}
  S = \textrm{SINT} \cdot I \cdot \Delta t
\end{equation}

For completeness, irradiance can be recovered from a signal in ADU and the integration time via Eq
\ref{eq:count_to_irrad}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:count_to_irrad}
  I = \frac{S}{\textrm{SINT} \cdot \Delta t}
\end{equation}

\section{Astronomical Spectra}

Four of the quantities needed for the background model vary with wavelength. These are the atmospheric
transmission, the sensor quantum efficiency, the irradiance of a 0th magnitude star, and the solar spectrum. Atmospheric transmission is a unitless quantity
conveying the fraction of light that is not absorbed by the atmosphere. Quantum efficiency is a
unitless quantity which conveys the fraction of incident photons which are (proportionally) converted
to photoelectrons in the CCD sensor. Each spectrum is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:spectra}.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\figbig]{sphx_glr_astro_spectra_001_2_00x.png}
  \caption{Astronomical Spectra}
  \label{fig:spectra}
\end{figure}

In practice, the quantum efficiency curve varies by sensor and the thermal conditions of the
observation. The curve adopted in this work is that used by Krag; modern sensors will often
perform better.
